# 3D Portfolio Site 

Welcome to my portfolio website!

This site is built using 3D objects for an interactive user design. It showcases all my current work experience and all the projects that I have worked on so far. 

Technologies used:
- React
- Vite
- Three JS
- Tailwind JS

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
